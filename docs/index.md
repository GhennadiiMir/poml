# POML Ruby Gem Documentation

Welcome to the POML Ruby Gem documentation - a Ruby implementation of the Prompt Orchestration Markup Language (POML).

**POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language)** is a novel markup language designed to bring structure, maintainability, and versatility to advanced prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). This Ruby gem provides full compatibility with the original POML specification.

## About This Implementation

This is a **Ruby port** of the original [POML library](https://github.com/microsoft/poml) developed by Microsoft. This Ruby gem is designed to be **fully compatible** with the original POML specification and has been **structurally aligned** with the original library to maintain complete compatibility.

> **âœ… Full Implementation Status**: Version 0.0.7 features complete structural alignment with the original library, including correct tools positioning and chat component behavior. **100% of tests passing** (399 tests, 2812 assertions) with all major functionality fully operational.

## Key Features

* **Structured Prompting Markup**: Employs an HTML-like syntax with semantic components such as `<role>`, `<task>`, and `<example>` to encourage modular design, enhancing prompt readability, reusability, and maintainability.
* **Comprehensive Data Handling**: Incorporates specialized data components (e.g., `<document>`, `<table>`, `<img>`) that seamlessly embed or reference external data sources like text files, spreadsheets, and images, with customizable formatting options.
* **Decoupled Presentation Styling**: Features a CSS-like styling system that separates content from presentation. This allows developers to modify styling via `<stylesheet>` definitions or inline attributes without altering core prompt logic.
* **Integrated Templating Engine**: Includes a built-in templating engine with support for variables (`{{ }}`), loops (`for`), conditionals (`if`), and variable definitions (`<let>`) for dynamically generating complex, data-driven prompts.
* **Ruby Integration**: Provides seamless integration into Ruby applications with a clean API for embedding POML into your Ruby workflows.

## Quick Start

Install the gem:

```bash
gem install poml
```

Basic usage:

```ruby
require 'poml'

# Process a POML document with tools
markup = '<poml><tool-definition name="search">Search tool</tool-definition><role>Assistant</role></poml>'
result = Poml.process(markup: markup)
puts result['content']
puts result['tools']    # Tools are at top level
```
