# Task

I developed a project called Prompt Wizard and I want to write a blog to publish on the company website. I have already written a draft of the blog. There has been figures, numbers in tables, the key challenges, motivations, as well as some titles and subtitles. I want you to complete the s in the draft.

# Output Format

Your response should be in the following format:

[Document: assets/103_prompt_wizard.docx]{
    "image": {
        "maxWidth": 500,
        "maxHeight": 500
    }
}
